📧 Spam Email Detection

A Data Science and Machine Learning project that detects whether an email/message is spam or ham (not spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classification algorithms. This project demonstrates how text data can be processed and transformed into meaningful features to build an effective spam filtering system.

🚀 Features

✅ Classifies emails/messages as Spam or Ham

🧹 Data Preprocessing – Text cleaning, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization

🔠 Feature Extraction – Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings

🧠 Machine Learning Models – Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM

📈 Model Evaluation – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

📊 Visualizations – WordClouds and data distributions

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Core language

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud – Visualization

Scikit-learn – ML algorithms & evaluation metrics

NLTK / SpaCy – Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization)

Jupyter Notebook – Development and analysis

⚙️ Workflow

Load dataset (e.g., UCI SMS Spam Collection or Enron Email Dataset)

Preprocess text (cleaning, tokenization, stopwords removal)

Convert text to numerical features using BoW / TF-IDF

Train ML models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)

Evaluate model using classification metrics

Predict whether new messages are spam or ham

🎯 Applications

📩 Email providers – Automatic spam filtering

🔒 Cybersecurity – Detect phishing attempts

📱 SMS spam detection – For telecom services

📌 Future Enhancements

Deep Learning models (RNN, LSTM, BERT) for better text understanding

Real-time spam detection system

Deploy as a web or mobile app
